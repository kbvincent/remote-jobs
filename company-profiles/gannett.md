We're very active slack users, developers, administrators, and evangelists.  We've built various slack apps to make our remote culture more productive and fun.
    
We're also very active with Zoom.  We have shared zoom screens at headquarters where you can join and see/chat with local team members.  We've developed a webcam up remote culture that encourages developers to be present for common hours to facilitate a collaborative environment.
